	<p> He is known as "TMO". No one knows his actual name is believed to not actually have one. <br>Everyone that knows him can vouch for his friendly character and someone that you can rely on. But that's just it, people only know his character, not him.<br> There are rumors of him claiming to have come down from "the skies" and what not which seems bizarre. <br>
	<br>Until now. You will be the first to somewhat understand who "he" is.  </p>
