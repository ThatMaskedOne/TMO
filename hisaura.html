	<p>A rare video found of<br> TMO when he is seemingly out of character<br> and not the energetic and active person people seem to know.
		<br>
		<br>
For this final project, I was inspired to go for a more anime approach since characters in anime have their own unique theme<br> that defines and expands upon the character. I combined two simple concepts such as the still stance of my character and the simple melody in the back<br> to create a unique atmosphere of my own. I would more consider this as a combination between an animation short and a music video since neither<br> the animation nor the music outhshines each other, they both work in parallel. The overall video is supposed to convey a true sense of peace in a mystery,<br> where the tone feels ominou but the beautiful moon and calming winds makes you feel more calm than anxious. Originally I had planned to add 2 scenes in which<br> my character clears his throat and creates a void in one hand, and fire in the other, but I thought that would have taken away from the overall mood that I wanted to convey<br> and so I felt the extra work would have been unnecessary. In the end, I created a loop that lasted for 1 second and I duplicated that loop enough in order to match the time limit of the song.<br> I gave the clip a slow fade in and fade out to ease the viewers into the atmosphere as thrusting them into it would defeat the purpose and the outcome of <br>the final animation came out as good as the idea that I originally had in my head.
